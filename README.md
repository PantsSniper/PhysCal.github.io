PhysCal
=======

1.	Ideas and Concepts

-	The core structure will be a physics calculator, whose main function is to handle the logical element of calculating answers in physics.

-	The main two areas covered will be basic mechanics and electromagnetism.

-	Other areas can be added as development continues (advanced mechanics, quantum, relativity, astronomy, but they will come after the project is up and running)

-	To add utility and appeal for teachers, a module can be added after launch that elaborates on the logic in word form, which can help clarify the reasoning used better than numbers. This could be expanded later in a khan academy-esque database, but this thought is WAAAAY underdeveloped and shouldn’t be worried about.

-	Money can come from ads on the site, web traffic, and however the fuck websites make money through people looking at them. If we want to get really hardcore we can pull a wolfram alpha and charge a fee for premium access to all services (such as the previously mentioned database and conceptual explanation, though this will drive off a potentially large chunk of people).

-	Steve has much more idea as to actually hosting or implementing the site than I do, so Steve as you are the one reading this dedicate all questions therein to yourself. Or tell me about it and then ask me. 

-	Given the intended scale of this thing I intend for it to be a website/web-based application. This can be changed and decided on later as we continue development on github.

2.	Creation process

-	A lot of development can take place over the summer depending on how much free time we each have (as of this writing I have a SHITLOAD).

-	We collaborate over github and share thoughts about everything listed in part 1 (as well as whatever new ideas may arise).

-	My intent is to bugcheck and make each section PERFECT before labeling it complete. A complete list of “sections” can be found in the timeline below.

-	A possible issue may arise in that I am not very good with programming and Steve knows jack shit about physics, I can fill in his gaps and he can help me in conjunction with programming websites online. We’re putting together something that will make us money, not a stupid blackjack simulator for the ugly cunt of a professor who sneezed on me during a test last year.

3.	Tentative (open to change) development timeline
NOTE: No actual dates are listed or required, this is just my thought up order of events.


•	Proto Proto Pre Alpha Baby Stage
-	Begin development. Set up accounts on necessary sites. I learn programming and help Stove learn what he needs with physics.
-	Decide on visual format, layout, how shit will look/how that’s implementable.
-	Start actual programming with the kinematics section (balls flying, basic motion)
-	Debug and perfect kinematics section
-	Begin Dynamics (forces)
-	Debug and perfect dynamics
-	Begin Energy and Momentum (This, I believe, will be the most challenging one)
-	Debug and perfect En&Mo
-	Begin Rotational Motion (Will encompass or relate back to a lot of previous material, may be a challenge)
-	Test that the UI works well and that calculations are accurate and capable of taking into account all possible variations on a subject (will be done during initial development of section, but a final runthrough won’t hurt)
Here development can continue into the next stage, or we can spread the completed section to friends of ours who would find it useful/check it out. This would be for further bugtesting/getting the word out there. At present I think it should only be spread around if it’s a web based program but that may change. Decisions can be made in time but I think continuing development on an up to completion would work much better than releasing it half done and going from there.

•	Alpha Stage
-	Begin development of Electromagnetism section
-	Proceed along the E&M subjects as we did with Mechanics (will require brushing up by me).
•	Launch Version
-	Includes full calculator support for Mechanics and E&M, while providing the base for future iterations and features (listed above)
