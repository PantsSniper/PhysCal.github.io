This is a design doc for giving official names and designations to all elements of a standard PhysCal calculation page.

Existing purely for clarification purposes it can/will be edited in time to keep up with whatever we choose to designate 
new components.


Variable Selection: The first interactable element of the calculation page, the user designates a variable they want to 
calculate from a selection of check-able boxes

Value Entry: The second interactable element, user enters values for all other variables used in the equation necessary to 
calculate the variable previously selected.

Submit Button and Result Box: The submit button is, in our current pertinent designworks, the third and final interactable 
element. The user clicks on it to perform the calculation set up in the two previous elements. The final resultant value 
for the selected variable is then displayed in the result box.
