Possible Answers:

Initial position (xi), Final position (xf), Velocity (v), Time (t), Acceleration (a), Initial velocity (vi), 
Final velocity (vf), Distance travelled (d)



Variable entry and equation permutations:

// Use of the symbol || is meant to indicate the word "OR", and is equivalent to indicating a split situation
// Use of the word or is used only to indicate the presence of a drop down menu to choose between two variables (a and d)

xf: xi, v, t, a

xf = xi + vt +(1/2)at^2


xi: xf, v, t, a

xi = xf - v*t - a*t^2 


v: xi, xf, t, a

v = (xf - xi - a*t^2)/t


t: xi, xf, a or v || vi, vf, a

// For clarification, t can only be calculated (as far as we care anyway), when either a or v = 0 The following equations apply to those cases

t = (xf - xi)/v         (a = 0)

t = sqrt((xi - xf)/a)   (v = 0)

t = (vf - vi)/a         (separate case, clarifying comment does not apply to this)


a: xi, xf, v, t || vi, vf, t or d

a = (xf - xi - v*t)/t^2

a = (vf - vi)/t

a = (vf^2 - vi^2)/2d


vi: vf, t, a or d

vi = vf - at

vi = sqrt(vf^2 - 2ad)


vf: vi, t, a or d

vf = vi + at

vf = sqrt(vi^2 + 2ad)


d: vi, vf, a

d = (vf^2 - vi^2)/2a

//This quantity (distance) is also equivalent to xf - xi, might make understanding certain things easier.
